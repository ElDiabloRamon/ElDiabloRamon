=============================================================


15.1. Adding Swap Space

Sometimes it is necessary to add more swap space after installation. 
For example, you may upgrade the amount of RAM in your system from 
1 GB to 2 GB, but there is only 2 GB of swap space. It might be 
advantageous to increase the amount of swap space to 4 GB if 
you perform memory-intense operations or run applications that 
require a large amount of memory. 

You have three options: create a new swap partition, create 
a new swap file, or extend swap on an existing LVM2 logical 
volume. It is recommended that you extend an existing logical volume. 





15.1.1. Extending Swap on an LVM2 Logical Volume

By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 uses all available 
space during installation. If this is the case with your 
system, then you must first add a new physical volume to 
the volume group used by the swap space. For instructions 
on how to do so, refer to Section 14.2.2, “Adding Unallocated 
Volumes to a Volume Group”. 

After adding additional storage to the swap space's volume 
group, it is now possible to extend it. To do so, perform 
the following procedure (assuming /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 
is the volume you want to extend by 2 GB): 


Procedure 15.1. Extending Swap on an LVM2 Logical Volume

1. Disable swapping for the associated logical volume: 

# swapoff -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01


2. Resize the LVM2 logical volume by 2 GB: 

# lvresize /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 -L +2G


3. Format the new swap space: 

# mkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01


4. Enable the extended logical volume: 

# swapon -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01


To test if the logical volume was successfully extended, use cat 
/proc/swaps or free to inspect the swap space. 





15.1.2. Creating an LVM2 Logical Volume for Swap

To add a swap volume group (assuming /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02 
is the swap volume you want to add): 


1. Create the LVM2 logical volume of size 2 GB: 
# lvcreate VolGroup00 -n LogVol02 -L 2G


2. Format the new swap space: 
# mkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02


3. Add the following entry to the /etc/fstab file: 
# /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02 swap swap defaults 0 0


4. Enable the extended logical volume: 
# swapon -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02


To test if the logical volume was successfully created, use 
cat /proc/swaps or free to inspect the swap space. 





15.1.3. Creating a Swap File

To add a swap file: 


Procedure 15.2. Add a swap file

1. Determine the size of the new swap file in megabytes and 
multiply by 1024 to determine the number of blocks. For example, 
the block size of a 64 MB swap file is 65536. 


2. Type the following command with count being equal to the 
desired block size: 
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536


3. Setup the swap file with the command: 
# mkswap /swapfile


4. It is recommended that the permissions are changed to 
prevent the swap being world readable. 
# chmod 0600 /swapfile


5. To enable the swap file immediately but not automatically at 
boot time: 
# swapon /swapfile


6. To enable it at boot time, edit /etc/fstab to include the 
following entry: 

/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 

The next time the system boots, it enables the new swap file. 


To test if the new swap file was successfully created, use 
cat /proc/swaps or free to inspect the swap space. 

-------------------------------------------------
15.2. Removing Swap Space

Sometimes it can be prudent to reduce swap space after installation. 
For example, say you downgraded the amount of RAM in your system 
from 1 GB to 512 MB, but there is 2 GB of swap space still assigned. 
It might be advantageous to reduce the amount of swap space to 1 GB, 
since the larger 2 GB could be wasting disk space. 

You have three options: remove an entire LVM2 logical volume used for 
swap, remove a swap file, or reduce swap space on an existing LVM2 
logical volume. 





15.2.1. Reducing Swap on an LVM2 Logical Volume

To reduce an LVM2 swap logical volume 
(assuming /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 is the volume you want to reduce): 


Procedure 15.3. Reducing an LVM2 swap logical volume

1. Disable swapping for the associated logical volume: 
# swapoff -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01


2. Reduce the LVM2 logical volume by 512 MB: 
# lvreduce /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 -L -512M


3. Format the new swap space: 
# mkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01


4. Enable the extended logical volume: 
# swapon -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01


To test if the swap's logical volume size was successfully 
reduced, use cat /proc/swaps or free to inspect the swap space.
